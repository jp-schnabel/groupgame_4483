Hello!

Welcome to Forest Rescue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Game

I've attached as part of my submission an executable application for MacBook, please run it on MacOS for best compatibility. Should you have any questions in regard to launching or building the game, please feel free to contact me at my email jschnab@uwo.ca.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic sequence:

Please wait for the crawling text on the opening scene to finish to get to the main menu. From there, you may start a new  game. The player must progress one level at a time through the level select scene, navigating to a new level each time and beating each one before the next (each successive level unlocks the next). The player keeps doing this until they reach the final boss level, defeat the boss and wins the game!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic game controls are this:

---
In-game:

Right arrow key to move right ->
Left arrow key to move left <-
Space bar to jump
Space bar while your in the air to double jump
Jump on top of enemies to defeat them

---
Level select:

Use arrow keys to navigate as normal
Press 'space' when player icon is hovering over a level to join the level

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy & tips:

Make sure to always walk past the check points. If you jump over them and do not make physical contact then the check point will not register your new spawn location.

Try and get to the end of the level, it does not matter if you kill all the enemies in between you and Commander Seth. Defeat enemies by jumping on top of them. As a note, it will take around 5 jumps in order to defeat Commander Seth.

The player can take damage from spikes, frogs, birds and Commander Seth. The player can see their health bar in the top left. The player may re-heal themselves by finding berries. Berries can be found sporadically throughout the map, or they can be found sometimes randomly after defeating an enemy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level specific tips:

Level 1, take your time with the jumps

Level 2, make sure not to jump over check points and watch out for the spikes!

Level 3, sometimes the jumper will push you up, if not stand on the hill and try and jump on the platform. Watch out for the falling spike and find the switch in order to unlock the door and beat the level.

Level 4, take your time with the jumps and make sure not to jump over the check points.

Boss, move quickly as soon as you inflict damage on the boss to avoid being destroyed by his attacks. The frequency speeds up as he gets weaker, so the faster you move the lower the odds of getting wrekt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

Unfortunately, after finishing levels 3 and 4 the player is not automatically brought back to the level select scene, instead they are brought back to the main menu scene where they then have to hit continue. Another bug is at the end of levels when the player continues to run or otherwise act irregularly even though the level has been completed. Finally, when navigating the level select sometimes the player will seem to transport across the path like they are floating. Make no mistake, these are not intentional and should be fixed for a final release of Forest Rescue.

Resources:

As a relatively inexperienced game developer I relied heavily on tutorials and asset packs in order to achieve my finished product. A list of GitHub repo's that I found from tutorials will be listed below, from these I borrowed some scripts, assets, and sound effects. The end result was a Frankenstein of many different resources I found on the internet to try and create some cohesion and create an interesting game experience. Thank you for taking the time to play my game :)
